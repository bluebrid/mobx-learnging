 * Welcome to the mobx sources! To get an global overview of how MobX internally works,
 * this is a good place to start:
 * https://medium.com/@mweststrate/becoming-fully-reactive-an-in-depth-explanation-of-mobservable-55995262a254#.xvbh6qd74
 *
 * Source folders:
 * ===============
 *
 * - api/     Most of the public static methods exposed by the module can be found here.
 * - core/    Implementation of the MobX algorithm; atoms, derivations, reactions, dependency trees, optimizations. Cool stuff can be found here.
 * - types/   All the magic that is need to have observable objects, arrays and values is in this folder. Including the modifiers like `asFlat`.
 * - utils/   Utility stuff.
